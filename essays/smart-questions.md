Many people say that there are no right or wrong answers or there are no stupid questions. But is that really true? When is comes to computer science, it is key for programmers to have a strong suit in communication in order to lead to both efficient and effective help. We all know that learning a programming language is not an easy thing to do. It takes time and practice to be the best at it. Not everyone knows the answer to everything nor is well documented. 

## Is there really such thing as a stupid question?

I mean I guess so... [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) itself even has a own article to help users learn [how to ask a good question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask). The article has a guideline to follow that will make sure you're asking a good question. The question needs to be on-topic and have a title that sums up the problem. 

Example:

Bad: JavaScript Confusion

Good: Why does str == "value" evaluate to false when str is set to "value"?

This article "[JavaScript - Function not executing properly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39680332/javascript-function-not-executing-properly)" did not do well on giving a good title or question. The author should have done more research before posting a question. It was marked as a duplicate or showed that there was any research effort. One thing that went wrong, was that he inputted a long code which readers don't want to see. Readers want authors to post minimal, complete, and verifiable examples and just not just every single line on the code. The more code there is to go through, the less likely people can find your problem.

## What is a smart question?

Stack Overflow, a question and answer site for programmers, is a great resource for anyone who may have issues with code or who may simply want to learn new or different methods of doing something. There I found examples of good questions and bad questions, which could probably be improved. In the following example, the title is clear on their confusion of the difference between the two. Granted, it’s a relatively easy question to answer. But perhaps it is only easy to answer because it is phrased well. 

A question from Richard Garside asked the community: [var functionName = function() {} vs function functionName() {}](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/336859/var-functionname-function-vs-function-functionname)

___

I've recently started maintaining someone else's JavaScript code. I'm fixing bugs, adding features and also trying to tidy up the code and make it more consistent.

The previous developer used two ways of declaring functions and I can't work out if there is a reason behind it or not.

The two ways are:
```
var functionOne = function() {
    // Some code
};
```
And,
```
function functionTwo() {
    // Some code
}
```
What are the reasons for using these two different methods and what are the pros and cons of each? Is there anything that can be done with one method that can't be done with the other?

While the heading of his question could be better, it does convey what he’s trying to figure out. Usually something as brief as “python date of previous month” is what other users would enter in as search terms on Google, making it easily found. Another good thing about the question is that it’s not just a question. The asker shows what he or she has done and that he or she has put in some effort to answer the question. And while it may not be as important as the question itself, the asker shows courtesy, which does increase the chance of getting an answer.

The asker received forty-one possible answers, and they were successful in inciting discussion from multiple users. Asking questions may not always get you the best answer, but asking them in a way that will make others want to answer them will increase the success of finding a good solution and make it a positive experience on all sides.
