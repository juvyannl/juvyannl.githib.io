## Experience 
My experience first learning what the essential skills are for software engineers was very educational. I've aquired skills with fundamental software engineering concepts that include coding standards, functional programming, user interface frameworks, design patterns, and many more. As a college student, I aspire to become an software engineer some day and this experience espically helped me understand key concepts in the tech field. 

## Open Source Software Development

Open source software development is a type of software development that allows anyone to view, modify, and enhance the source code. It is a collaborative effort where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community. It is a great way to learn from other programmers and to help each other out. 

## Coding Standards

Coding standards are a set of guidelines, best practices, programming styles, and conventions that developers adhere to when writing source code for a project. It is a way to communicate with other programmers and to help them understand the code. It is extremely important to making coding assignments well-organized and easy to read.

## Functional Programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.

## Conclusion

The knowledge and skills I have learned in this class will help me with my journey to become a software engineer. Software engineering is not only about web application development but it goes way beyond that.
