*Why learn JavaScript? It's AMAZING!*

Pre-semester of my Software Engineering class, I learned the basics of how to write in JavaScript. I learned the basics in under a day and enjoyed writing it. It's my new favorite tool to use out of every other language. What is it you may ask... JavaScript is one of the most popular and likeable languages according to majority of statistics. It has abilities that can make a website or applications come to life. 

## Java and JavaScript are NOT the same

Many people wonder if the two differ or if their the same based on how similar their names are. I used to think that Java and javaScript were the same but throughout my college years, I've learned that they are two different programming languages! Java focuses more on Andriod development and scientific computing while JavaScript focuses on web/game development. Sure they both languages perform very high on a browser and have very similar syntax such as loops and if/else statements. Aside that they are total different things that are in their own different world! 

## Practice of WOD's

I believe that practicing Workout-Of-the-Day problems will help me out in the long run when applying for tech jobs and also help build myself as a programmer. Learning JavaScript is basically learning a whole new language. Practice, repitition, and effort can lead to success at fully understanding the language. The challenge and struggle will help with stepping out of my confort zone and shows a little side of what happens in the real world outside of school.

## Conclusion

So back to the original premise; Why learn JavaScript?

And the final answer - I feel like its a great programming language for first-time programmers who want to learn the tool. It is used in a number of other career paths you choose including app development, full-stack web development, video game development, AI, and much more. I do aspire to be a front-end developer or a software engineer. It's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.
