## Introduction

Artificial intelligence and software engineering collorate together because it allows developers to build an efficient user-centric applications. It is a branch of computer science that is concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. It is a tool that can be used to help developers create a more user friendly experience. AI tools that I have used are ChatGPT and Co-Pilot. In my eyes these tools make my life easier by giving accurate suggestions and is constantly helping me learn from my mistakes. I personally like to use Co-Pilot more. I installed Co-Pilot in my IntelliJ and from my experience it saves me a lot of time because it has pattern recognition which can predit code snippets. It makes the job not so repetitive but more manageable. 

## Personal Experience with AI

Experience WODs e.g. E18: The experience WODs were a great way to get an idea of how long it takes me to complete different tasks. I was able to get a better understanding of my strengths and weaknesses as a software engineer and discover areas of improvement.
In-class Practice WODs: Typically, for in-class WODs, students would be assigned to work with a partner. I found this opportunity to be very beneficial because it allowed me to work with other students and learn from them. It was an enlightening experience to view the different approaches students took to solve the same problem. I did not use AI tools for in-class WODs because I thought it was important for me to find an answer on my own or ask for help from my partner for a good challenge.
In-class WODs: For in-class WODs, I had havw used AI for some of them when I get stuck on a something I cant solve for more than 5 minutes. 
Essays: AI isn’t too useful for essay either, as in this class essay is just a way to express our experience and often requires little to none technical competence.
Final project: I find myself using AI alot for the final project, it is the quickest way for me to test out my idea and explore new knowledge needed for the project.
Learning a concept / tutorial: I didn’t have to use AI for any of them, as most materials had their own official documentation that I can refer, or had resources that was one Google search away, on top of all the resources that the professors already include in the modules.
Answering a question in class or in Discord
Asking or answering a smart-question: Personally, I have been lacking when it comes to answering and helping out other students in this class, as I rarely check the discord, except for when I do run into problems, then I would look in the smart-questions channel to see if someone else had the same issue, and how they solved it.
Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
Explaining code: This is one of this strong area of AI, since it’s explanation is adjustable base on your needs and provides a lot of personable examples instead of hard text explanation. I find myself using AI a lot to explain certain use of Code and it often net a positive result.
Writing code: I use AI a bit when writing code like when I have to make new pages for my project or help with homework. For example, I used ChatGPT to ask, “Can you make a basic page just displaying the navbar and footer.” And I would give it my navbar for reference for example. It would make a skeleton page just so I wouldn’t have to manually type out code for the basic parts of the page.
Documenting code: Documenting goes hand in hand with understanding code. I know what my code is supposed to do and where it does it so I would be able to document what is going on myself. I would use AI to help me with the syntax of the documentation.
Quality assurance: Quality assurance was something I struggled with a lot. I would often get error messages because something went wrong and I’d turn to ChatGPT and would ask “How to fix this error: *insert error message here” and it would pop up a step by step solution to my issue. Sometimes this would work, but other times it was not helpful at all

## Impact on Learning and Understanding

AI has definitely influenced my learning experience as it has impacted me on my comprehension, skill development, and problem solving abilities. Using AI has taught me that I really need to know what I am asking before I ask it a question.

## Practical Applications

AI is very useful in the real world outside of ICS 314. One of the main points of AI is that it can speed up production of certain things. Software engineers and game designers won’t need to spend as much time coding as they could be testing new, exciting things rather than fixing basic bugs.

## Challenges and Opportunities
A challenge I have encountered while using AI is whether I am using it compromising my learning experience. It is really easy to just copy and paste my homework assignments into ChatGPT and have it do it for you.

## Comparative Analysis

Traditional teaching methods and AI options have many strengths and weaknesses. One of AI’s advantages in the development of practical skills is that it can give immediate feedback on coding techniques, which speeds up the software engineering learning curve. However, AI is not perfect and can sometimes give incorrect answers. This can be a problem for students who are not familiar with the subject matter and are unable to tell if the answer is correct or not. Traditional teaching methods are more reliable in this regard, as they are able to provide feedback on the student’s work and help them improve their skills.

## Future Considerations

I for sure know that AI will eventually get better at learning specific details of people, and personalizing answers better to everyone individually. In software engineering, I believe that eventually AI would be able to work side by side with developers in making coding easier to develop.

## Conclusion

AI is a great tool to use for programmers, and non-programmers. Through the use of ChatGPT, I could be able to find solutions to specific errors and problems in my code faster, as well as get general ideas on how to do things.
