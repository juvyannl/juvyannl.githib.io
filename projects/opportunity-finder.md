## Overview

Opportunity Finder is a web application that helps students find opportunities to gain experience and companies to find the perfect candidate for the job. This project was created for my ICS 314 Software Engineering class. The goal of this project is to create a web application that allows students to find opportunities to gain experience and companies to find the perfect candidate for the job. This project was created using IntelliJ, Javascript, HTML, Meteor, and GitHub.

The problem: Many UH computer science and engineering students want to learn about internship and job opportunities, but currently they must wait until a company decides to visit the campus or send out some sort of announcement. There is no efficient way for students to understand the “landscape” of internship and job opportunities that might be available in the future, so they can prepare for them now.

The solution: The Company Connector web application provides a new way for local and non-local companies who want to recruit students from UH to make their (potential) opportunities known to students. At the same time, students can create profiles on the site with their interests. The site can match students to employers and vice-versa.

## Contributions
Me along with 3 other members on my team had 4 weeks to create a web application that would make a positive impact to the community. We split the 4 week project into 3 milestones where each student is assigned to two issues that are needed to be fixed in that week. 
My contributions to this project include creating the add profile page, the edit profile page. I also helped with the design of the home page and the profile page. I also helped with the testing of the application and documentation of this project.

## My experience

I learned what it was like to work with a team and how to communicate with other team members. I gained more experience on how to use GitHub and how to use it to collaborate with other team members.
